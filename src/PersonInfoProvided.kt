//Type checking and typecasting:

        println("not a session info provider")
    }else {
        println("is a session info provider")
        //Typecasting:
        //Typecasting means converting a variable from one data type to another.
        //It tells the compiler: ‚ÄúTreat this value as if it were of another type.‚Äù
        //In the example below, we're telling the compiler, treat this parameter like it is of type SessionInfoProvider which means:
        //we want the compiler to give access of methods and variables inside SessionInfoProvider to infoProvider. I'm guessing that sth being an instance of sth doesn't mean that you can access all the methods and variables cz infoProvider is already an instance of SessionInfoProvider if this else statement is executed
        //(infoProvider as SessionInfoProvider).getSessionId()//We cast to access the methods in the interface however this is not necessary since we have already validated that infoProvider is an instance of SessionInfoProvider so instead we use:
        infoProvider.getSessionId()//This is smart casting. You'll notice that infoProvider is highlighted. The computer is doing smart casting which  is accessing the methods and variables of an interface without having to cast each time. We are able to access the method without casting bcz infoProvider is an instance of SessionInfoProvider

    }
}
//What I've understood from this checking method is that you want to see if it is an instance of certain method
//So you create a parameter{infoProvider}. We passed provider in checkTypes as an argument{ checkTypes(provider) }
//provider had used methods printInfo2 and getSessionId therefore it is an instance of both of them that's why the output will be "is a session info provider"





//Recap: Difference between a class, an object and an interface
//A class is a blueprint (template) for creating objects.
//Example:
//class Car(val brand: String, val speed: Int) {
//    fun drive() {
//        println("$brand is driving at $speed km/h")
//    }
//}
//Here, Car is a class that describes what a car looks like (brand, speed) and what it can do (drive).
//
//An object is an instance of a class (a real-world thing created from the class blueprint).
//Example:
//val car1 = Car("Toyota", 120)
//val car2 = Car("BMW", 180)
//car1.drive()
//Each object has its own values for the properties but shares the structure defined by the class.
//
//An interface is like a contract that defines what methods a class should have, but does not provide the full implementation.
//A class can implement multiple interfaces.
//Example:
//interface Drivable {
//    fun drive()
//}
//class Bike : Drivable {
//    override fun drive() {
//        println("Bike is moving üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è")
//    }
//}
//Here:
//Drivable is an interface (just a promise that "drive()" exists).
//Bike implements it, giving its own version of "drive()".
//
//Analogy:
//Class = Recipe for a cake
//Object = The actual cake you baked
//Interface = A contract saying "any dessert must have a sweetTaste() method"
